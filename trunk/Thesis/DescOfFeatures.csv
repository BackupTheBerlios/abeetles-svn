Agents(=objects of the environment of the simulator, who are subject to a life cycle and evolution.)
Body
Motion
Behavior(=what they do besides motion, mating,eating)
Features(=features that change during life)
Life-span
Genes(=representation of genes)
Phenotypic space(=space of all possible phenotypes of agents)
Learning(=whether some ability to learn is included in model of agents)



Number of offsprings in one reproduction
Algorithm used for creation of genes of an offspring
Choice of partner(=features that a partner must have to be chosen for mating)
Conditions of mating(=what conditions must be satisfied before mating)
Investment in offspring(=the amount of some resource, usually energy, that is given to an offspring by its parents at its birth)


Description(=what does the environment look like)
Features(=parameters of the environment, that are not represented by objects contained in the environment)
Inhabitants(=objects, that inhabit the environment together with agents)

UI settings(=attributes, in which can a user influence the artificial life run by the simulator. They are sorted in 3 cathegories)
Mating
Life of individual
Environment

Statistics(=output of summary information about a run of the simulator)

Implementation(=features of implementation of the simulator)
Distribution of computation(=whether and how it is possible to distribute the computation of the artificial life in the simulator to more computers)
Speed settings(=whether and how it is possible to influence the speed of computation)
Available sources(= whether source file of the simulator are available)
Availability of binaries(=under what conditions are binaries available, e.g. on registration, free, ect.)
Programming language(=programming language used and key libraries)
