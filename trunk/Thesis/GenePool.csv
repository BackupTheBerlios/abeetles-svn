;Gene Pool
;Parameter based
Agents;swimbot
Body;mouth, genitals and 2-10 parts for moving
Motion;swimming using parts, algorithm common for all swimbots
Behavior;nothing
Features;energy
Life-span;not restricted
Genes;(?)
Phenotypic space;length, width, system of attachment, phases and amplitudes of every part
Learning;no
Mating;
Number of parents;2
Number of offsprings;1
Genetic algorithm;crossover algorithm with mutation
Choice of partner;"in round ""view horizon"" at one snapshot. Swimbot chooses at one snapshot in his ""view horizon"" one mate, that most satisfies his attractiveness criterion"
Conditions of mating;swimbots mate when at least one of them is pursuing the other and the distance between their genitals is less than the length of the genital vector
Investment in offspring;50% of actual energy
Environment;
Description;rectangular pool
Features;constant amount of energy in environment, cyling: food->swimbots->pool->food
Inhabitants;food bits, swimbots
UI settings;
Mating;attraction criterion
Life of individual;location in environment, creation a swimbot, hunger threshold, energy for offspring
Environment;food growth - birth delay, spread radius, energy from 1 piece
Statistics;graph of number of swimbots vs. food, features of individual, the best one in attraction/mating/eating

;
do uvodu:;how good is a swimbot in reproducing, which means either being good at swimming or being attractive to other swimbots
