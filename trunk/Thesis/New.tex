%******************Definition of Artificial life*********************
Artificial Life, (commonly \textbf{Alife} or \textbf{alife}) is a field of study and art form that examines systems related to life, its processes and its evolution through simulations using computer models, robotics, and biochemistry (called "soft", "hard", and "wet" approaches respectively \cite{Bedau}).

Because of its predominance within the field, the term "Artificial Life" is often used to specifically refer to soft alife.%source??

The term Artificial life was first coined by Christopher Langton in the late 1980s at the first "International Conference on the Synthesis and Simulation of Living Systems" (otherwise known as Artificial Life I) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1987. He envisioned a study of life as it could be in any possible setting.

Artificial life studies "natural" life by attempting to recreate biological phenomena from scratch within non-living media like computers or RNA structures of molecules. Alife complements the traditional analytic approach of traditional biology with a synthetic approach in which, rather than studying biological phenomena by taking apart living organisms to see how they work, one attempts to put together systems that behave like living organisms.

The process of synthesis has been an extremely important tool in many disciplines. Synthetic chemistry - the ability to put together new chemical compounds not found in nature - has not only contributed enormously to our theoretical understanding of chemical phenomena, but has also allowed us to fabricate new materials and chemicals that are of great practical use for industry and technology.

Artificial life amounts to the practice of "synthetic biology" and, by analogy with synthetic chemistry, the attempt to recreate biological phenomena in alternative media will result in not only better theoretical understanding of the phenomena under study, but also in practical applications of biological principles in the technology of computer hardware and software.\cite{Langton} 

The seminal novelty of ALife lies in its synthetic approach. Whereas traditional research is essentially analytic, breaking down complex systems into basic components, Alife attempts to construct complex systems from elemental units.\cite{BornhoffenLataud}

For example, answering of questions like how the simple rules of Darwinian evolution lead to high-level structure, or the way in which the simple interactions between ants and their environment lead to complex trail-following behavior promises to provide novel solutions to complex real-world problems, such as disease prevention, stock-market prediction, and data-mining on the Internet.\cite{AdamiBrown}

Artificial life can be split into various subfields according to chosen substrat of the system (digital, mechanical or test-tube) as well as according to aspect of natural life, that is in the focus of the research.


%replace this to another chapter!!
%*************Evolutionary computation: if we choose evolution of biological life as the topic of our artificial life exploration and simulate it using computers.
One of terms related to Artificial life is Evolutionary computation. It is a general term for several computational techniques which are based to some degree on the evolution of biological life in the natural world and simulated using computers. Evolutionary computation thus uses techniques of natural world and applies them using computers in other fields of interest. The most widely used form of evolutionary computation are Genetic Algorithms. Evolution techniques are often focused on evolution of motion, shape, visual art and music. 
 
%************History of Alife as a science
%The only source: Wikipedia - History of artificial life. However, citations are poor in this article. 
%Exists:Artificial Life and the Sciences of Complexity: History and Future, 	Jean-Claude Heudin. But it is not accessible for free.
%1hour of searching. Lets stop it.

%************Contemporary course of this science


%***********This thesis is about -> software
This thesis deals with digital substrate, so it is bounded within software approach to Artificial life. Because of the fact that Artificial life uses synthetic methods, the logical realization of software based Artificial life are software simulators that perform the construction of complex systems from elemental units.

%***********Target of this work: 1.set of features 2.simulator 3.experiments
Target of this thesis is to introduce a simulator named Abeetles, that mimics life of simple organisms and is concerned with evolution of deliberately chosen features and behavior. The system avails experiments with evolution of the organisms under different conditions. Furthemore, several experiments performed with the system are described and a few other proposed.

%Pøesné vymezení problému
%5 pages about precise definition of the problem - description of chosen existing brother programs and comparison and choice of my objectives. I will use the Porovnani.xls 
%******************Context of my thesis - cathegories of Alife simulators and ranking of my work. Short about existing brother programs and programs that inspired me.
Software simulators of Artificial life can be ranked in many ways. This thesis will expand on three classification possibilities. First, cathegorisation according to the method of creature definition will be used. Second, simulators will be distinguished with respect to the feature or features of Artificial life, that they attempt to simulate. Third, the criterion of purpose of the simulator and target group of users will be used. The fourth section places Abeetles into these classification systems and thereby specifies sphere of Artificial life that will be dealt in this thesis.

\section{Classification by creature definition}
Individual agents are in existing systems modeled and constructed in many different ways. Most of them can be classified in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Program Based} - In program based simulators an individual is represented by a program, which substitutes biological DNA. Language of the program is usually Turing complete. Assembly derivatives are the most common languages used. Tom Ray's Tierra is the most famous example of a program based simulator.
    \item \textbf{Module Based} - An agent in a module based system is a composition of individual modules. These modules modify the creature's behaviors and characteristics either directly, by hard coding into the simulation (leg type A increases speed and metabolism), or indirectly, through the emergent interactions between a creature's modules (leg type A moves up and down with a frequency of X, which interacts with other legs to create motion). Generally these are simulators which emphasize user creation and accessibility over mutation and evolution.  
    \item \textbf{Parameter Based} - If an organism is generally constructed with defined and fixed behavior that is controlled by various parameters that mutate, the system is referred as a parameter based. That means that each organism contains a collection of numbers or other finite parameters. Each parameter controls one or several aspects of the organism in a well defined way.
    \item \textbf{Neural Network Based} - These simulations have creatures that learn and grow using neural networks or a close derivative. Emphasis is often, although not always, more on learning than on natural selection.
\end{itemize}

\section{Classification by simulated phenomenon}
Another grouping of simulators can be done according to phenomenon, that they try to simulate. It is presented at the web page of Monash University’s Complexity Virtual Lab. \url{http://vlab.infotech.monash.edu.au/}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Networks} - Complex natural systems are simulated according to network theory (or diktyology) as networks or graphs and their statistical and topological properties are analyzed. 
  \item \textbf{Nonlineality} - Nonlineal systems are systems that cannot be mathematically described as a sum of their components. While certain assumptions can be made for linear systems, that often make the mathematical modelling of such systems easy, mathematical modelling of nonlineal systems is often very difficult or impossible. As a result, nonlineal systems are often studied through use of simulations.
  \item \textbf{Swarms} - A swarm is a group of independent agents that gather together in order to collectively carry out a certain task. Typically, each agent exhibits a very simple behaviour pattern that is influenced by direct or indirect interactions with other swarm members. As a result, the swarm as a whole may exhibit complex and intelligent behaviour patterns. In nature, swarms can be observed in social insects, fish schools, but also in primitive single cell organisms.
  \item \textbf{Evolution} - Evolution is the process of development or grows by accumulation of small advantageous changes. The study of all forms of evolutionary processes is one of the primary goals of ALife. This includes the study of biological evolution of species as well as other evolutionary processes in natural, artificial and social systems.
  \item \textbf{Cellular Automata} - A cellular automaton (CA) is a discrete model that consists of a cell-grid, where each cell is in one of a number of well-defined states. The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions, though the mostly studied CAs have one or two dimensions. The time in the model is discrete and the state of each cell C at time t depends only on the cell-states within some well-defined neighbourhood of C at time t-1. The update function (also called the update rule) is a table that defines the state for each cell at time t as a function of the state of the neighbourhood of C at time t-1. Cellular automaton is not really phenomenon of the natural life, it is a  discrete model of mutual influence of neighboring elements, which can be in the nature observed. 
\end{itemize}  

\section{Classification by purpose}
Apparently, the main purpose of Artificial life simulators is to simulate artificial life. The target can be the complexity of simulation as well as the concentration on a small selection of its attributes. As the simulator is a software system, it is designed for a certain group of users and expected usage. And decision in this field influence interface, adjustability and output of the program. Also availability of the system is related to the purpose. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Games} Frequent purpose of simulators is entertainment, because game industry is constantly researching for new ideas to animate artificial characters. Simulators from this class are usually supplied with attractive user interface, but neither artificial life techniques and settings nor source corde are accessible to examination. The game Creatures is a well-known example of an artificial life computer program series, created in the mid-1990s by English computer scientist Steve Grand. The program is regarded as an important breakthrough in the advancement of artificial life research.
  \item \textbf{Scientific simulators} A simulator can be designed primarily for use as a platform in Artificial Life research. Such programs allow to perform experiments in certain subfields of Alife, e.g. evolutionary dynamics, theoretical biology etc. They are usually highly adjustable and configurable and afford opportunities to gather high-quality statistics. The grafical output is not expected to be the most important feature, in comparison with games. They are often open source. Tom Ray's system Tierra and Avida from Devolab are such simulations. 
  \item \textbf{Simulators for teaching purposes}
Efforts of creators of a simulator can be also concencentrated on an idea of demonstration of natural life processes using computer with the objective that through experimentation and interactive play users learn underlying patterns of life. Intriguing example is the simulator Mitozoos, where through mutation of spider-like agents can anybody explore relationship between genetic code and life. 
\item \textbf{Related systems}
Many systems are closely related to Artificial life simulators, but they are not considered as Artificial life systems, because they only use techniques, that originate from Alife like genetic algorithms or ant colony optimization. Their purpose can be various. The primary difference lies in the fact that these programs explicitly define the fitness of an agent by its ability to solve another problem than find food, reproduce and avoid death as it is typical for artificial life simulators. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Classification of Abeetles}
As far as definition of agents is concerned, target class of Abeetles are parameter based systems. Space of possibilities of Abeetles is bounded by finite number of parameters and Abeetles avails to explore what implies which setting of parameters in the world of this system.

In classification by simulated phenomenon Abeetles can be ranked among systems concerned with evolution. But the field of evolution is too wide and features that Abeetles examines will be described later. %Add in which section!!

The purpose of Abeetles is to be a prototype of scientific simulator. But not only for users from comunity of computer scientists, but also for those, who appreciate user friendly interface, even if it decreases performance of the system. 

\section{Term related to fields of concern of Abeetles}
%dopis, docisti!
Abeetles concerns with evolution. For writing about matters, that are concerned with it, several key terms should be included. Gene is a structural unit of inheritance in living organisms. A gene is, in essence, a segment of DNA that has a particular purpose, i.e., that codes for (contains the chemical information necessary for the creation of) a specific enzyme or other protein.\cite{GeneDic}
The distinction between phenotype and genotype is fundamental to the understanding of heredity and development of organisms. The genotype of an organism is the class to which that organism belongs as determined by the description of the actual physical material made up of DNA that was passed to the organism by its parents at the organism's conception. For sexually reproducing organisms that physical material consists of the DNA contributed to the fertilized egg by the sperm and egg of its two parents. For asexually reproducing organisms, for example bacteria, the inherited material is a direct copy of the DNA of its parent. The phenotype of an organism is the class to which that organism belongs as determined by the description of the physical and behavioral characteristics of the organism, for example its size and shape, its metabolic activities and its pattern of movement.
\cite{GenPhen}
In biology the genome of an organism is its whole hereditary information and is encoded in the DNA (or, for some viruses, RNA). This includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA. The term was coined in 1920 by Hans Winkler, Professor of Botany at the University of Hamburg, Germany, as a portmanteau of the words gene and chromosome.\cite{GenomeDef}
%Furthemore should be explained: genome

\chapter{Precise definition of targets of the system Abeetles}

%Objectives of this thesis have already been briefly mentioned in the first chapter. This chapter has for its objective precise description of these targets and explanation of context of individual bullets where necessary. 
%no.. these are targets of all thesis, but this chapter is about targets of simulator Abeetles.

%First, swift enumeration: Targets of this thesis are to design the simulator Abeetles, implement it and  introduce several experiments to be run on the simulator. %This is just shortcut of paragraph from the first chapter

%Abeetles: simulates evolution of agents in environment
The main target of Abeetles, as well as of other similar programs, is to simulate artificial life. But artificial life is rather a general idea, because to simulate all natural life as we know it on the Earth is with contemporary means impossible. Therefore every simulator chooses just a restricted subset. As stated above, Abeetles is concerned with evolution. But even this field is too wide. The next step is thus to specify what will be evolved and how will look like the world, where it will be evolved. In the following text the subject of evolution will be called agents and the world will be called environment. 



%Target of this kind of simulation: models not like anything natural, but despite it search for features, that would bring them closer to natural ones. 
Abeetles is one of simulators, where both environment and agents are very simplyfied abstractions that do not have any concrete model in the nature. Abeetles does not endeavor to simulate any existing organisms, but to explore features of natural processes like evolution or natural selection and others on organisms that are from their basis virtual. Interesting question, that arises from this kind of simulation of evolutional processes is, what should parameters of agents and environment, whose models have little in common with real life, look like, so as to cause, that the results and course of evolution would resemble patterns of natural organisms in their environment.  

%with specific features and in This chapter will focus on more detailed features of the system Abeetles, will explain their context and outline their targets.%The third - is it true?

Browsing in the Internet, one easily ascertains, that there are already many simulators of artificial life. Therefore it is necessary to define targets of Abeetles in the context of other artificial life simulators. Attributes of several of these "brother programs" will be described in details and afterwards features of environment and agents of Abeetles will be chosen through careful comparison. For this purpose will serve five existing simulators, that should exemplify: Avida, Bitozoa, Gene Pool, Mitozoos and Primordial life. Reasons for choice of each of them will be described later. Common attribute of all of them is that their binaries are freely or almost freely accesible. Abeetles is also free software and is intended to examine contributing set of features of natural life only within free software.
%Alternative:Accordingly Abeetles only strive to present an original set of features and attitudes among well-described parts of free and accesible implementations of artificial life.

%Already written at the beginning of the paragraph:
% Features of selected simulators will be described and on their base will be chosen the set of features of the nature Abeetles will focus on and other attributes of the simulator.

The simulators are classified by twenty-seven features. Features are sorted into   
six cathegories: Agents, Mating, Environment, User interface settings and implementation.

Cathegory Agents contains following features: Body(=description of body of agents), Motion(=how do agents move), Behavior(=what they do besides basic activities of life - motion, mating and eating), Features(=features that change during life), Life-span, Genes(=representation of genes), Phenotypic space(=space of all possible phenotypes of agents), Learning(=whether some ability to learn is included in model of agents)

Cathegory Mating comprises: Number of offspring in one reproduction, (Genetic algorithm(=algorithm used for creation of genes of a descendant), Choice of partner(=features that a partner must have to be chosen for mating), Conditions of mating(=what conditions must be satisfied before mating), Investment in offspring(=the amount of some resource, usually energy, that is given to a descendant by its parents at its birth)

Cathegory Environment includes: Description(=what does the environment look like), Features(=parameters of the environment, that are not represented by objects contained in the environment),Elements(=objects, that inhabit or are placed in the environment together with agents)

Cathegory User Interface Settings  encompasses attributes, by which can a user influence the artificial life run by the simulator. They are sorted in 3 cathegories, Mating, Life of individual and Environment.

Cathegory Statistics is alone.

Cathegory Implementation holds: Implementation(=features of implementation of the simulator), Distribution of computation(=whether and how it is possible to distribute the computation of the artificial life in the simulator to more computers), Speed settings(=whether and how it is possible to influence the speed of computation), Available sources(= whether source file of the simulator are available), Availability of binaries(=under what conditions are binaries available, e.g. on registration, free, ect.), Programming language(=programming language used and key libraries)

\section{Features of Abeetles}
%Abeetles is a successor of Broucci(bez pameti)
The original idea of Abeetles is to create a successor of existing program Broucci (=Beetles) introduced by RNDr. Tomas Holan Phd. as an example of different attitude to solution of complex problems. It is not an artificial life simulator, but it could be classified as Related system. It uses genetic programming to solve a specifical problem. The assignment of Broucci is that there is a world where beetles live. Beetles can move - make a step, rotate left and rotate right. The step can go to an empty space or eat a beetle and occupy its place. They can see what is around them - in the front, on the left and on the right. Find an algorithm, that should a beetle use so as not to die of hunger and not be eaten up by another beetle. Solution described by the author is a console program where beetles are visualized as arrows turned in the direction of beetles sight. Beetles take turns regulary and alway when the number of beetles goes down under certain lever, new beetles are created from the most successful ones using genetic crossover algorithm. Parents do not meet.\cite{Broucci}

  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Broucci.eps}
  \caption{Broucci}
  \label{obr.graphicx}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Abeetles takes over following ideas of Broucci: beetles can move by sequence of steps and rotations. They see what is in the front, on the left and on the right.

"Brother programs" were compared according to 27 different cathegories. Abeetles does not strive to be contributing in all these cathegories. Instead of it, four were chosen as the key ones: motion, learning, choice of partner, distribution of computation and elements of environment - obstacles. The following table compares Abeetles with other solutions specificaly in this cathegories.

Artificial life in simulator Abeetles simulates natural life as environment inhabited by agents. Agents are those elements of environment that are subject to evolution and environment is all the world with other not evolved objects where agents live.

Agents in Abeetles are called beetles and generally they all are of the same species as they can mate with each other and bear descendants, and share the same static part as well as constrains on the variable part of their behavior. Environment is a grid in form of toroid. In the grid  three types of objects are placed. Beetles are the only inhabitants of the environment that are able to move. Another type of objects are flowers. Flowers grow in cells of the environment and serve as food for beetles. Neither beetles nor flowers can occur in cells of the grid, where are walls. Walls are static obstacles that serve for forming of the shape of the environment.

Beetles contain static part, that can not be evolved, evolvable part and part that can be influenced during life by learning. Basic features are level of energy, decision mechanism that takes as input what the beetle see and in which state he is and outputs a decision what to do and expectation on a partner for mating.

\section{Functionality of Abeetles}

The simulator runs the artificial model described above. Scenarios of usage can be encapsulated in three particular cases of usage: Running of an experiment, view of an experiment, and learning of possibilities and the artificial life performed by the simulator.
%A co soupnout napad tehle tri scenarii uz do Chapter 3?

\subsection {Running of an experiment}
The expectations on the system in this case are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Speed: Experiment run with the simulator should avail execution of thousands of turns so as to get interesting results of evolution. Also for statistical purposes high number of various inputs must be used when experimenting on random data. Therefore Abeetles should offer possibility to run very fast. 
\item Input: Start of experiments can not be done manually one by one. Data entry should be read from a script. 
\item Output data: Results of experiments should be possible to save in an interchangeable format and make their collection automatically.
\item Run of the simulator: Simulator should just obtain script at start and then run without need for any input from user. 

\end{itemize}

%Scenarion of running of an experiment - sequence diagram.

\subsection{View of an experiment}
\begin{itemize}
\item User interface: Interface should offer possibility to look at the environment with all its object so as to see particular situation in the environment that cannot be logged in statistics, e.g. differences between beetles in separate parts of the environment. This could be realized by ability to visualize different aspects of the environment on demand and by ability to zoom various parts of the environment. Also details of individual beetles should be accessible in a concise form. 
\item Run of simulator: Simulator should be capable of running step by step, of running optional number of turns or of running until being stopped.
\end{itemize}

%Scenario of view of an experiment

\subsection{Learning about Abeetles}
%aspect of understanding of the model and work of Abeetles.
\begin{itemize}
\item Speed: A slow run of the simulator helps to see what is happening and understand relationships between events.
\item User Interface: The interface should show all the environment with clearly differentiated objects. Legend, explaining what is what, should be easily reachable. A zoom can make possible to see the situation in details as well as to overlook the whole environment.
\item Input: Possibility to start default interface with random beetles easily is necessary at the beginning of work with the simulator. Also to save and continue to work with it later.
\item Output: To view actual statistics can be performed in any turn.  
\end{itemize}

%Scenario of Learning about Abeetles.



%Nelibi se mi: Objectives of the simulator imply requirements on the application: which features it should have and which functionality it should offer to users.


%From chapter 1: Cathegorisation of Abeetles.

%As far as definition of agents is concerned, target class of Abeetles are parameter based systems. Space of possibilities of Abeetles is bounded by finite number of parameters and Abeetles avails to explore what implies which setting of parameters in the world of this system.

%In classification by simulated phenomenon Abeetles can be ranked among systems concerned with evolution. But the field of evolution is too wide and features that Abeetles examines will be described later. %Add in which section!!

%The purpose of Abeetles is to be a prototype of scientific simulator. But not only for users from comunity of computer scientists, but also for those, who appreciate user friendly interface, even if it decreases performance of the system.

\subsection {Hardware architecture}
First, it is necessary to decide, which targets of Abeetles and features recognized by analysis are key for design of architecture of the system. System should be as fast as possible when computing experiments. Simultaneously it should avail to go slowly and display the situation at every step.
Speed can be from the point of view of hardware improved by distribution of computation. 

But is the model of Abeetles suitable for parallelization of computation? The distribution speeds up the computation only if the task can be separated into independent subtasks and the costs of interchange of data after he completion of each subtask do not prevail the savings from paralel run of the subtasks.

The first question is whether computation of artificial life of Abeetles can be split into independent subtasks. Generally, the run of an artificial life simulator is a sequence of more or less detached updates. In each update each  object in the environment gets opportunity to make a small number of actions, usually one, with one input of information from the environment, e.g. snapshot of its surroundings. Interactions in the environment should be only local, so as to split the environment into several parts and each of them compute on a different machine. 

In Abeetles the environment is a grid in the form of a toroid. Beetles see only three neihbouring cells. As described later, growth of flowers is dependent only on a setting of each cell. Therefore interactions are only local and paralelization could be covenient. 

A possibility of division of the task is splitting of the environment into parts that compute every update separately, run on different computers and after each update send and receive information about the edges that can be in view of objects in the neighboring parts of the environment. Two alternatives of realization of such distribution are: the first, The parts on individual machines are equal applications that communicate peer-to-peer. Each application knows only information about its part of environment and about the borders of neighbors. Despite the peer-to-peer character, this organization needs a server node that starts and stops the other nodes and collects results.

% Deployment (?-nebyl by lepsi nejaky popis zprav?) diagram of this situation according to schema in notysek.

The other one is that there is a central server that splits the environment, sends the parts to individual machines, all the machines compute one update and return the result to the server.

%Deployment diagram of this situation according to schema in notysek.

Be all the environment of the shape of a square, split into n smaller squares. Length of an edge of such a square is x. Radius of view of an object in the environment is v. Then in the first case the number of exchanged messages is 4n and each message carries information of size av. In the second case the number of messages is 2n and size of contained information is a^2. 

%Pro co tedy vlastne tenhle agrument mluvi? Je posilani vetsich zprav alespon dvakrat pomalejsi? Ve chvili kdy se zprava musi rozdelit na dve mensi, tak urcite je.

Advantage of the peer-to-peer attitude is that it is probably faster. Advantages of client - server attitude are possibility to see the all situation and save statistics of the environment without any additional costs. Also control and solving of unexpected situations is much easier.

I would be very interesting to know, whether any of these methods of distribution be so effective would secure such considerable speed-up that would outweigh all the costs of the distribution.

For Abeetles the distibution using peer-to-peer alternative was previously considered, but it would need a great deal of work that exceed the possibilities of this thesis. Nevertheless, implementation of data structure of the grid of the environment is prepared for usage in the peer-to-peer model. 

Abeetles is now an application that runs on a single computer.

\subsubsection {Modules of Abeetles}
Important facts from analysis that influnce choice of layout of modules are usage as a tool for experiments, which expect fast run without visualisation, and usage as a viewer and a learning tool, which expects slow run with elaborate graphical interface. Separation of these two attitudes therefore comes into consideration.

Abeetles could be designed as a tool containing two separate application, that can only share the representation of data. First is a graphical viewer and second is a program run from command line of a console application. This attitude is used by simulator Avida. Avida contains even three kinds of applications: graphical viewer, console application and primitive run with only listing of updates in a console.

Abeetles was first considered to be designed in this way, but paralel development of two applications with many functionality in common was abandoned. The reason is based also on fact, that for Abeetles the program language C++ together with graphical library QT by Trolltech was used, as described in following section. The console application could be, unlike the gui version, written without any gui concerned libraries. These libraries (e.g. QT by Trolltech, Win32API or MFC) contain useful tools for work with files and parsing of text, which are necessary operations in both versions. Develop these operations using non library construct would be more difficult and time consuming and the work does not bring anything new. Do it twice using different instruments would also not be effective. And when in simple application a gui library is also used, then there is no reason to separate the functionality connected with different cases of usage to two independent applications.

Division of application into modules could also follow separation of computation of artificial life from all wrapping functionality. The computation could be called as a dynamical library. For reusage of the core of Abeetles with different interface it would be convenient and it would also be suitable for cooperation of more developers. Abeetles are planned to be prepared for transfer to other operation systems, unix based or MacOS. And dynamical libraries are only usable at one system.

To sum up, Abeetles is an application that contains only one module, that serve for both purposes - running of experiments as well as overlooking individual situations in an environment and learning about Abeetles. Disadvantege lower reusability, but it simplified development and conforms to future compilation at different operation systems.

\subsubsection{Choice of platform and programming language}
Speed was the leading criterion when the question of programming language was considered. Model of Abeetles invokes realization by a class based languages, the abstraction is intuitive. Abeetle needs graphical interface and to the chosen language a library for creation of gui should be accessible. Three languages were taken into account: Java, C# and C++. Both Java and C# are, thanks to interpretation of bytecode at runtime, slow in comparison with C++. But a Java application can be run at different OS and is a language of "higher" level than C++. C# applications can run only on Windows, but the future support will be only better. It is as slow as Java. The criterion of speed was considered more important for Abeetles that

\section{Description of the model of a beetle}
%This is 
 Representation of an agent(beetle) in Abeetles from genetical point of view:
Chromosome of a beetle includes following genes:\\
\\
Brain [2][4][4][4] - Set of actions, each of them is chosen by the beetle in the proper situation. Situation is defined by the quaternion (hunger,what is in the left, the front, the right). Item "hunger" specifies whether or not is the beetle hungry. Values of what is in the three directions from the beetle are four: beetle, flower, wall or nothing. These four possibilities are precisely the four possible contents of cells of the environment.\\
Actions, for which the beetle can decide in this situations are chosen from the following set: make one step, turn right, turn left.\\
Originally there were five actions: these three and copulation and waiting. Decision for copulation has sense only in situations, where is another beetle in front of the beetle and when the beetle is not hungry. And, furthemore, it these situations the beetle should always or almost always copulate (add here more rigorous explanation)when he meets another beetle. As a result, it is compulsory action in case a beetle sees another beetle in front of him.\\
 The action waiting was omitted - it gets beetles into deadlock situation. They should never decide for waiting, when they are hungry, because there cannot grow any flower on the spot, where they are staying. And when they are not hungry, it might be useful only as waiting for somebody to come and make child with him. But even in this situation it is not clever - beetle cannot finish it, because it has no memory. So it waits until it gets hungry or situation around changes.\\

\section {Paralelisation}

\subsection Idea of paralelisation in Abeetles:
Paralelisation should distribute the computation of the grid environment for abeetles on several computers. As the environment is a grid, it can be cut into rectangular parts, each of this executed and evolved on a different source computer. This parts can have versatile size according to performance of the computer. With this schema, the number of fields of one part, that are computed on one computer is up to quadratical to width(heigth) of the part and number of fields of one part, that need communication with other parts is linear (four times) to width(heigth) of the part.\\
Why paralelisation can make the computation quicker: Beetles are located in a grid, so the interactions between the grid cells are similar to those of a celular automata - each beetle interacts only with its nearest neighborhood.
Artificial systems such as Tom Ray's tierra \cite{Tierra} have opened the possibility of studying evolvable systems. The study of evolution in such an information-rich artificial environment requires ever larger and faster systems, and present systems are largely restricted by such limits.
Distributing overmultiple processors is not practical on a large scale, because of the non-local interaction between members of the tierran population. But the system Avida developed the idea of the environment towards distribution. Avida is based on an array of cells that interact only with their nearest neighbours and an update mechanism reminiscet of 2D cellular automata.\cite{Avida} \\
Nevertheless Avida system does not include distributed computation in its latest implementation, neither in older ones.
Abeetles should exploit ideas presented in the article about Avida, follow suggestions about local interaction and other improvements of Avida and implement them in a system, that will execute in a paralel way. But unlike Avida, Abeetles will be a parameter based system, not a program based.




\subsection Choice of tool for Abeetles:
There are two main tools used for paralelisation of computation. PVM(Paralel virtual Machine) and MPI(Message Passing Interface). Comparison of features has been published in an article \cite {PVM versus MPI}

    \subsubsection {Topology:}
    MPI provides higher level of the message-passing topology. In MPI a group of tasks can be arranged in a specific logical interconnection topology. PVM does not support such an abstraction, the programmer is to manually arrange tasks into groups with the desired communication organization.
    For Abeetles the concept of MPI would be more convenient. But the organization of squares as parts of a toroid should be simple enough to realize using PVM.

    \subsubsection {Fault Tolerance:}
    Fault tolerance is important for any long-running simulation.  PVM has supported a basic fault notification scheme. Using this scheme individual tasks can inform other tasks about faults and respond to faults without hanging or failing.

    \subsubsection {Resource Control:}
    PVM is inherently dynamic in nature. Computing resources can be added or deleted any time. In a long­running application in which the user occasionally wishes to attach a graphical front­end to view the computation's progress. Without virtual machine dynamics, the graphical workstation would have to be allocated during the entire computation. MPI lacks such dynamics and is, in fact, specifically designed to be static in nature to improve performance.
    Abeetles intends to be such an application - fast running, with rare user requests for graphical view of progress (possibly) or graphs and metrics of the course of the computation. Thus PVM should serve better for the case of Abeetles.

    \subsubsection {Process Control:}
    Ability to stop and start tasks in included both in MPI(v.2.0) and PVM.

    \subsubsection {Portability versus Interoperability:}
    MPI programs are only portable, which means that they can be ported from one architecture to another, compiled and executed without modification. PVM programs can be dealt in the same way, but moreover can also communicate with each other.

    \subsubsection{Context for Safe Communication:}
    Offered by both MPI and PVM (v.3.4.)

    \subsubsection{Speed:}
    MPI is expected to be faster within a large multiprocessor. Reason is MPI's simplicity.

\section {Genetical Algorithm}

\subsection {Choice of genetical algorithm for Abeetles}

Representation of an agent(beetle) in Abeetles from genetical point of view:
Chromosome of a beetle is the set of variables, representing the beetle:

Brain [2][4][4][4] = 128B

I will consider the individual brain decisions as noninteracting and availe placing of a crossover point anywhere after finished set of decisions

I want following variables to be logicaly noninteracting and thus it should be possible to place a crossover point anywhere among them. Hence I represent the expectations on a partner as relative divergence from other values.

ExpectOnPartner - Age [2] = 2B how much older / younger can be the partner
ExpectOnPartner - Energy = 1B how much more than ExpectOnPartner - InvInChild
ExpectOnPartner - InvInChild = 1B how much more than InvInChild
ExpectOnPartner - LearningAbility [2]= how much less/more can have the parter
InvInChild = 1B
HungryThreshold = 1B
LearningAbility = 1B

For implementation of crossover step the possible crossover points must be carefully chosen. The target is to find points, that availe separation of the genome into two noninteracting groups. Otherwise the crossover is not important for evolution and may be omitted.

Points can be placed between any pair of adjacent variables. Two created parts will be independent


Generally:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1.selection
  \item 2.crossover
    \begin{itemize}
      \item One-point crossover: This algorithm seems to be useful for the case of Abeetles. I will implement it as the first.
      \item Two-point crossover: This algorithm seems to be useful for the case of Abeetles. I will implement it.
      \item "Cut and splice": This technique is not suitable for case of Abeetles, because created children have different length of chromosomes.
      \item Uniform Crossover and Half Uniform Crossover: These aproaches may also be useful.
      \item Crossover for Ordered Chromosomes
    \end {itemize}
  \item 3.mutation
\end {itemize}

\section {Memory of beetles}
Beetles without memory have no chance to vary their decision, if the situation around them is constant. And if the decision is anything else than a step, their repeat this until they get hungry, die or the situation changes. But in case their are already hungry and the situation is a for long time constant, they are determined to die. And in the range of whole environment, if there are few beetles in the environment, they become extinct.
The other problematic situation ocurrs, when two beetles meet and want to copulate with each other. They might make a child or more, but then they do not have enough energy to create another child and get into deadlock, until situation around them changes or one of them dies. (Ne.. tohle nevadi, protoze se zmeni situace z hladove na nehladovou. Postreh: obecne nema smysl, aby hladovi broucci mohli volit akci A_COPULATE Postreh2: A je nutne, aby broucek pri kazdem setkani s jinym brouckem provedl A_COPULATE) Solution: omit action A_COPULATE from list of possible actions and include it as "hardwired". So this action will be performed always when in front of a beetle is another beetle and no decision will be made in this case. In case the copulation did not create a child beetle, e.a. expectations were not met, the decision for the case "beetle in the front" will be made according to the Brain table.

Ways how to solve this problem:
1. Flowers could besides growing also die back. Such a solution would  cause the environment to vary in every step, even if beetle don't eat the flowers.
2. Beetles could get aditional memory, to determine a deadlock-like situation. This could be done in several different ways:
a) remember n past coords - a beetle which does not move is likely to die.
b) remember n past actions - a beetle which does some other action than the step more than 3 times (rotation) or more than once (unsuccessful copulation) does it wastefully.
