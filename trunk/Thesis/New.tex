%******************Definition of Artificial life*********************
Artificial Life, (commonly \textbf{Alife} or \textbf{alife}) is a field of study and art form that examines systems related to life, its processes and its evolution through simulations using computer models, robotics, and biochemistry (called "soft", "hard", and "wet" approaches respectively \cite{Bedau}).

Because of its predominance within the field, the term "Artificial Life" is often used to specifically refer to soft alife.%source??

The term Artificial life was first coined by Christopher Langton in the late 1980s at the first "International Conference on the Synthesis and Simulation of Living Systems" (otherwise known as Artificial Life I) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1987. He envisioned a study of life as it could be in any possible setting.

Artificial life studies "natural" life by attempting to recreate biological phenomena from scratch within non-living media like computers or RNA structures of molecules. Alife complements the traditional analytic approach of traditional biology with a synthetic approach in which, rather than studying biological phenomena by taking apart living organisms to see how they work, one attempts to put together systems that behave like living organisms.

The process of synthesis has been an extremely important tool in many disciplines. Synthetic chemistry - the ability to put together new chemical compounds not found in nature - has not only contributed enormously to our theoretical understanding of chemical phenomena, but has also allowed us to fabricate new materials and chemicals that are of great practical use for industry and technology.

Artificial life amounts to the practice of "synthetic biology" and, by analogy with synthetic chemistry, the attempt to recreate biological phenomena in alternative media will result in not only better theoretical understanding of the phenomena under study, but also in practical applications of biological principles in the technology of computer hardware and software.\cite{Langton} 

The seminal novelty of ALife lies in its synthetic approach. Whereas traditional research is essentially analytic, breaking down complex systems into basic components, Alife attempts to construct complex systems from elemental units.\cite{BornhoffenLataud}

For example, answering of questions like how the simple rules of Darwinian evolution lead to high-level structure, or the way in which the simple interactions between ants and their environment lead to complex trail-following behavior promises to provide novel solutions to complex real-world problems, such as disease prevention, stock-market prediction, and data-mining on the Internet.\cite{AdamiBrown}

Artificial life can be split into various subfields according to chosen substrat of the system (digital, mechanical or test-tube) as well as according to aspect of natural life, that is in the focus of the research.


%replace this to another chapter!!
%*************Evolutionary computation: if we choose evolution of biological life as the topic of our artificial life exploration and simulate it using computers.
One of terms related to Artificial life is Evolutionary computation. It is a general term for several computational techniques which are based to some degree on the evolution of biological life in the natural world and simulated using computers. Evolutionary computation thus uses techniques of natural world and applies them using computers in other fields of interest. The most widely used form of evolutionary computation are Genetic Algorithms. Evolution techniques are often focused on evolution of motion, shape, visual art and music. 
 
%************History of Alife as a science
%The only source: Wikipedia - History of artificial life. However, citations are poor in this article. 
%Exists:Artificial Life and the Sciences of Complexity: History and Future, 	Jean-Claude Heudin. But it is not accessible for free.
%1hour of searching. Lets stop it.

%************Contemporary course of this science


%***********This thesis is about -> software
This thesis deals with digital substrate, so it is bounded within software approach to Artificial life. Because of the fact that Artificial life uses synthetic methods, the logical realization of software based Artificial life are software simulators that perform the construction of complex systems from elemental units.

%***********Target of this work: 1.set of features 2.simulator 3.experiments
Target of this thesis is to introduce a simulator named Abeetles, that mimics life of simple organisms and is concerned with evolution of deliberately chosen features and behavior. The system avails experiments with evolution of the organisms under different conditions. Furthemore, several experiments performed with the system are described and a few other proposed.

%Pøesné vymezení problému
%5 pages about precise definition of the problem - description of chosen existing brother programs and comparison and choice of my objectives. I will use the Porovnani.xls 
%******************Context of my thesis - cathegories of Alife simulators and ranking of my work. Short about existing brother programs and programs that inspired me.
Software simulators of Artificial life can be ranked in many ways. This thesis will expand on three classification possibilities. First, cathegorisation according to the method of creature definition will be used. Second, simulators will be distinguished with respect to the feature or features of Artificial life, that they attempt to simulate. Third, the criterion of purpose of the simulator and target group of users will be used. Four section places Abeetles into thse classification systems and thereby specifies sphere of Artificial life that will be dealt in this thesis

\section{Classification by creature definition}
Individual agents are in existing systems modeled and constructed in many different ways. Most of them can be classified in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Program Based} - In program based simulators an individual is represented by a program, which substitutes biological DNA. Language of the program is usually Turing complete. Assembly derivatives are the most common languages used. Tom Ray's Tierra is the most famous example of a program based simulator.
    \item \textbf{Module Based} - An agent in a module based system is a composition of individual modules. These modules modify the creature's behaviors and characteristics either directly, by hard coding into the simulation (leg type A increases speed and metabolism), or indirectly, through the emergent interactions between a creature's modules (leg type A moves up and down with a frequency of X, which interacts with other legs to create motion). Generally these are simulators which emphasize user creation and accessibility over mutation and evolution.  
    \item \textbf{Parameter Based} - If an organism is generally constructed with defined and fixed behavior, that is controlled by various parameters that mutate, the system is referred as a parameter based. hat is, each organism contains a collection of numbers or other finite parameters. Each parameter controls one or several aspects of an organism in a well defined way.
    \item \textbf{Neural Network Based} - These simulations have creatures that learn and grow using neural networks or a close derivative. Emphasis is often, although not always, more on learning than on natural selection.
\end{itemize}

\section{Classification by simulated phenomenon}
Another grouping of simulators can be done according to phenomenon, that they try to simulate. \url{http://vlab.infotech.monash.edu.au/}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Networks} - Complex natural systems are simulated according to network theory (or diktyology) as networks or graphs and their statistical and topological properties are analyzed. 
  \item \textbf{Nonlineal} - Nonlineal systems are systems that cannot be mathematically described as the sum of their components. While certain assumptions can be made for linear systems, that often make the mathematical modelling of such systems easy, mathematical modelling of nonlineal systems is often very difficult or impossible. As a result, nonlineal systems are often studies through use of simulations.
  \item \textbf{Swarms} - A swarm is a group of independent agents that gather together in order to collectively carry out a certain task. Typically, each agent exhibits a very simple behaviour pattern that is influenced by direct or indirect interactions with other swarm members. As a result, the swarm as a whole may exhibit complex and intelligent behaviour patterns. In nature, swarms can be observed in social insects, fish schools, but also in primitive single cell organisms.
  \item \textbf{Evolution} - Evolution is the process of development or grows by accumulation of small advantageous changes. The study of all forms of evolutionary processes is one of the primary goals of ALife. This includes the study of biological evolution of species as well as other evolutionary processes in natural, artificial and social systems.
  \item \textbf{Cellular Automata} - A cellular automaton (CA) is a discrete model that consists of a cell-grid, where each cell is in one of a number of well-defined states. The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions, though the mostly studied CAs have one or two dimensions. The time in the model is discrete and the state of each cell C at time t depends only on the cell-states within some well-defined neighbourhood of C at time t-1. The update function (also called the update rule) is a table that defines the state for each cell at time t as a function of the state of the neighbourhood of C at time t-1.
\end{itemize}  

\section{Classification by purpose}
Apparently, the main purpose of Artificial life simulators is to simulate artificial life. The target can be the complexity of simulation as well as the concentration on a small selection of its attributes. As the simulator is a software system, it is designed for a certain group of users and expected usage. And decision in this field influence interface, adjustability and output of the program. Also availability of the system is related to the purpose. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Games} Frequent purpose of simulators is entertainment, because game industry is constantly researching for new ideas to animate artificial characters. Simulators from this class are usually supplied with attractive user interface, but neither artificial life techniques and settings nor source corde are accessible to examination. The game Creatures is a well-known example of an artificial life computer program series, created in the mid-1990s by English computer scientist Steve Grand. The program is regarded as an important breakthrough in the advancement of artificial life research.
  \item \textbf{Scientific simulators} A simulator can be designed primarily for use as a platform in Artificial Life research. Such programs allow to perform experiments in certain subfields of Alife, e.g. evolutionary dynamics, theoretical biology etc. They are usually highly adjustable and configurable and afford opportunities to gather high-quality statistics. The grafical output is not expected to be the most important feature, in comparison with games. They are often open source. Tom Ray's system Tierra and Avida from Devolab are such simulations. 
  \item \textbf{Simulators for teaching purposes}
Efforts of creators of a simulator can be also concencentrated on an idea of demonstration of natural life processes using computer with the objective that through experimentation and interactive play users learn underlying patterns of life. Intriguing example is the simulator Mitozoos, where through mutation of spider-like agents can anybody explore relationship between genetic code and life. 
\item \textbf{Related systems}
Many systems are closely related to Artificial life simulators, but they are not considered as Artificial life systems, because they only use techniques, that originate from Alife like genetic algorithms or ant colony optimization. Their purpose can be various. The primary difference lies in the fact that these simulators explicitly define the fitness of an agent by its ability to solve a problem, instead of its ability to find food, reproduce, or avoid death. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Classification of Abeetles}
As far as definition of agents is concerned, target class of Abeetles are parameter based systems. Space of possibilities of Abeetles is bounded by finite number of parameters and Abeetles avails to explore what implies which setting of parameters in the world of this system.

In classification by simulated phenomenon Abeetles can be ranked among systems concerned with evolution. But the field of evolution is too wide and features that Abeetles examines will be described later. %Add in which section!!

The purpose of Abeetles is to be a prototype of scientific simulator. But not only for users from comunity of computer scientists, but also for those, who appreciate user friendly interface, even if it decreases performance of the system.

\chapter{Precise definition of targets of this thesis}

Objectives of this thesis have already been briefly mentioned in the first chapter. This chapter has for its objective precise description of these targets and explanation of context of individual bullets where necessary.

%First, swift enumeration: Targets of this thesis are to design the simulator Abeetles, implement it and  introduce several experiments to be run on the simulator. %This is just shortcut of paragraph from the first chapter

Being only one simulator in the row of other artificial life simulators, it is necessary to define clearly, which features of natural life will Abeetles examine. For this purpose will serve five existing simulators chosen to be an important example. Reasons for choice of each of them will be described later. Common attribute of all of them is that their binaries are freely accesible. Abeetles is also free software and is intended to examine original set of features of natural life only within free software. Features of selected simulators will be described and on their base will be chosen the set of features of nature Abeetles will focus on  and other attributes of the simulator.

\section {Avida}
Avida is often presented example of a program based simulator. For definition targets of Abeetles is important Avida's implementation - two programs, gui and console version - serve to scientific purposes, can run very fast, but can ofer graphical output as well.

\section {Program-based}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Artificial Planet
    \item  Avida
        Avida is a digital world in which simple computer programs mutate and evolve. Each organism has its own virtual CPU and adapts to landscape and external fitness functions.\cite {Avida}

    \item  DarwinHom
    \item  Darwinbots
    \item  Evolve4.0
    \item  Framsticks
    \item  Grey Thumb Society Simulators
          (Archis, Nanopond)
    \item  Physis (software)
    \item  Tierra
            Tierra is a computer simulation developed by ecologist Thomas S. Ray in the early 1990s in which computer programs compete for central processing unit (CPU) time and access to main memory. The computer programs in Tierra are evolvable and can mutate, self-replicate and recombine. Tierra is a frequently cited example of an artificial life model; in the metaphor of the Tierra, the evolvable computer programs can be considered as digital organisms which compete for energy (CPU time) and resources (main memory).\cite{Tierra}
\end{itemize}


\section {Module Based}
Individual modules are added to a creature. These modules modify the creature's behaviors and characteristics either directly, by hard coding into the simulation (leg type A increases speed and metabolism), or indirectly, through the emergent interactions between a creature's modules (leg type A moves up and down with a frequency of X, which interacts with other legs to create motion). Generally these are simulators which emphasize user creation and accessibility over mutation and evolution.
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Spore (video game)
    \item  TechnoSphere
\end{itemize}

\section { Parameter Based }
Organisms are generally constructed with pre defined and fixed behaviors that are controlled by various parameters that mutate. That is, each organism contains a collection of numbers or other finite parameters. Each parameter controls one or several aspects of an organism in a well defined way.

\begin{itemize}
    \item  \textbf{Jeffrey Ventrella programs: Darwin Pond and Gene Pool }
            Darwin Pond is older version of the newer system Gene Pool. This system is an imaginary pool, where live swimbots. Swimbots move by swimming, eat food growing in the pool and reproduce sexually. This system was designed to explore topics of relations between natural and sexual selection.
Their Darwinian fitness is how good is a swimbot in reproducing, which means either being good at swimming or being attractive to other swimbots. So they evolve their swimming techniques and features that might be attractive to other swimbots. Author of this program published interesting discoveries about results of setting various attraction criteria. Criterion "still" (i.e., swimbots exhibiting the least amount of motion become the most attractive) causes swimbots to converge on distinct bifurcation among body types resembling sexual dimorphism.

                Model of the system: Swimbots consist of mouth, genitals and 2-10 parts,  which rotate and let the swimbot move. Parameters of this parts are coded in genes. Each swimbot has its current level of energy, which is used for moving, obtained from food and 50\% of it gives parent swimbot to its offspring. Amount of energy in all system is constant, changing in the way: food->swimbots->pool->food.
Swimbot chooses its mate for reproduction in its "view horizon" at one snapshot. It chooses one mate which most satisfied attractiveness criterion. Swimbots mate when at least one of them is pursuing the other, and the distance between their genitals is less than the length of the genital vector) one offspring
appears in-between them, which inherits genetic building blocks from both parents. A standard genetic-algorithm crossover technique is used, and some random mutation occurs in random genes.

                Settings of the program: The program avails to set the attraction criterion (big, similar color, long, still, crooked,... ). Swimbots can be moved by user, cloned or killed.

                Future development: Recursive embryology, Parental investment and gender.

    \item  Evolites (No official article, no precise information)
          Graphical game with creatures called evolites swimming in the sea.
          Organisms: round creatures, different colors
          Features: Energy, Hunger
          Reproduction: ??
          Environment: Sea with pieces of food
          Possibilities: Mutation blobs, food rate, ...

    \item \textbf{Mitozoos} \cite{Mitozoos}
Th e Mitozoos World is a model of artificial life calculated and generated graphically on a computer. It is is an educational and recreational
project to support study of evolution and genetics. It consists of two modules - the world and coders, which avail user to create their own mitozoos and send them to the running world. These modules can be deployed on different computers, world on one and coder on a number of other computers. Connection to internet is the only condition for them to cooperate.
Description of the model:
Organisms in this model are spider-like mitozoos with 2 eyes, body in shape of tetrahydron and four bent legs that inhabit a simulated threedimensional world. So as to move around, they must move their legs in sequence. The genome of a mitozoos consists of ten genes, each gene has four bases (four possible colors).
Relation between genome and phenome(graphic appearance and behavior) is determined by large set of rules. These rules are designed in such
a way that each element of the code is related to various aspects of the phenotype. The related traits simply depend on similar genes and rules, in other words, there is no such thing as a one-to-one relationship between the gene and the phenotype.
Each mitozoos has its energy level, varying durig its life, and procreation threshold stating, how much energy allows it to reproduce. Mitozoos moves in the 3D world, consumes its energy on it, eats food bits growing in the world and gets energy from them.
Individual physical features of each mitozoos are length of parts of its legs determining moving possibilities and procreation threshold. Next to it every mitozoos has behavior given by strategy of retrieving meal (up to which distance it walks rather then waits for one to appear closer, whether there are not too many other mitozoos nearby the food bit) and frequency and duration of resting periods.



the birth of individuals; the
existence of a genetic code that determines individuals’
appearance and behaviour; feeding (energy gain); the
dissipation of energy through activity; reproduction,
in which two individuals combine their genetic code in
order to give birth to a third individual (sexual reproduction);
and lastly, the death of individuals.
          Organisms: spider-like mitozoos, different colors, \\
          Features: Energy, copulation and risk threshold(?)\\
          Reproduction: sexual\\
          Environment: earth with pieces of food\\
          Possibilities: creation of new creatures with user affected genes.\\
          Multicomp: YES: One world, more creators of creatures\\

  \item Primordial life\\

    \item  Broucci - \url{http://ksvi.mff.cuni.cz/~holan/jinak/}
Broucci is a program, where beetles move in a toroid-shape area. Every time slot the worst beetle in the population is arbitrarily replaced by a new one, created as a crossover son of the best two ones.

    \item  "Cell Based" - Parameters control the expression of "genes" or "proteins" which can themselves interact in complex ways. The resulting organism's properties are largely emergent, but are still encoded in the genome with a finite number of parameters.
       \begin{itemize}
          \item  Cell-O-Sim (\url{http://mbi.dkfz-heidelberg.de/projects/cellsim/cellosim/index.html})
                 Organisms: cells,
             Features:

              Environment: tissue of cells
              Possibilities:
              Multicomp: ??
                 Under development

\end{itemize}

\section {Neural Net Based}
These simulations have creatures that learn and grow using neural nets or a close derivative. Emphasis is often, although not always, more on learning than on natural selection.

\chapter{Model of Abeetles}
%*******************1-2 pages about choice of my objectives according to previous chapter. I will use Porovnani.xls
Abeetles would like to contribute to the set of artificial life applications. Its predecesor is the program Broucci developed at the Faculty of Mathematic and Physics at Charles University in Prague by RNDr.Tomas Holan Phd. as a  sample program for teaching purposes. The source code of Broucci is available at \url{http://ksvi.mff.cuni.cz/\~holan/jinak/}.

Program Broucci implements interesting ideas - evolution of strategy of motion of simple beetles in a grid with obstacles or in case when beetles eat each other. Closer description of this application can be found in chapter Survey of existing artificial life applications. Abeetle overtook some of these ideas and strives to apply them in new ways.\\
On the whole, there are quite a few artificial life applications. This topic became famous in past decade and encouraged this field of knowledge to considerable development. Existing applications cover wide range of interesting features and access the problematics from different points of view. Some of these applications and articles on this topic work are accessible completely, with all documentation, other are poorly documented or without source code and some are even not accessible freely at all. For example the website of International Society of Artificial Life demands membership fees for access to presented information. Therefore the objective to allocate a set of features and attitudes for a new artifical life system that would be verifiably original is hardly reachable.

Accordingly Abeetles only strive to present an original set of features and attitudes among well-described parts of free and accesible implementations of artificial life.



\section{Chosen features}
    All the evaluated artificial life applications were compared in 33(TO CHECK) cathegories. For Abeetles four were chosen as the key ones. The following table compares Abeetles with other solutions specificaly in this cathegories.

\section{Description of the model of a beetle}
Representation of an agent(beetle) in Abeetles from genetical point of view:
Chromosome of a beetle includes following genes:\\
\\
Brain [2][4][4][4] - Set of actions, each of them is chosen by the beetle in the proper situation. Situation is defined by the quaternion (hunger,what is in the left, the front, the right). Item "hunger" specifies whether or not is the beetle hungry. Values of what is in the three directions from the beetle are four: beetle, flower, wall or nothing. These four possibilities are precisely the four possible contents of cells of the environment.\\
Actions, for which the beetle can decide in this situations are chosen from the following set: make one step, turn right, turn left.\\
Originally there were five actions: these three and copulation and waiting. Decision for copulation has sense only in situations, where is another beetle in front of the beetle and when the beetle is not hungry. And, furthemore, it these situations the beetle should always or almost always copulate (add here more rigorous explanation)when he meets another beetle. As a result, it is compulsory action in case a beetle sees another beetle in front of him.\\
 The action waiting was omitted - it gets beetles into deadlock situation. They should never decide for waiting, when they are hungry, because there cannot grow any flower on the spot, where they are staying. And when they are not hungry, it might be useful only as waiting for somebody to come and make child with him. But even in this situation it is not clever - beetle cannot finish it, because it has no memory. So it waits until it gets hungry or situation around changes.\\

\section {Paralelisation}

\subsection Idea of paralelisation in Abeetles:
Paralelisation should distribute the computation of the grid environment for abeetles on several computers. As the environment is a grid, it can be cut into rectangular parts, each of this executed and evolved on a different source computer. This parts can have versatile size according to performance of the computer. With this schema, the number of fields of one part, that are computed on one computer is up to quadratical to width(heigth) of the part and number of fields of one part, that need communication with other parts is linear (four times) to width(heigth) of the part.\\
Why paralelisation can make the computation quicker: Beetles are located in a grid, so the interactions between the grid cells are similar to those of a celular automata - each beetle interacts only with its nearest neighborhood.
Artificial systems such as Tom Ray's tierra \cite{Tierra} have opened the possibility of studying evolvable systems. The study of evolution in such an information-rich artificial environment requires ever larger and faster systems, and present systems are largely restricted by such limits.
Distributing overmultiple processors is not practical on a large scale, because of the non-local interaction between members of the tierran population. But the system Avida developed the idea of the environment towards distribution. Avida is based on an array of cells that interact only with their nearest neighbours and an update mechanism reminiscet of 2D cellular automata.\cite{Avida} \\
Nevertheless Avida system does not include distributed computation in its latest implementation, neither in older ones.
Abeetles should exploit ideas presented in the article about Avida, follow suggestions about local interaction and other improvements of Avida and implement them in a system, that will execute in a paralel way. But unlike Avida, Abeetles will be a parameter based system, not a program based.




\subsection Choice of tool for Abeetles:
There are two main tools used for paralelisation of computation. PVM(Paralel virtual Machine) and MPI(Message Passing Interface). Comparison of features has been published in an article \cite {PVM versus MPI}

    \subsubsection {Topology:}
    MPI provides higher level of the message-passing topology. In MPI a group of tasks can be arranged in a specific logical interconnection topology. PVM does not support such an abstraction, the programmer is to manually arrange tasks into groups with the desired communication organization.
    For Abeetles the concept of MPI would be more convenient. But the organization of squares as parts of a toroid should be simple enough to realize using PVM.

    \subsubsection {Fault Tolerance:}
    Fault tolerance is important for any long-running simulation.  PVM has supported a basic fault notification scheme. Using this scheme individual tasks can inform other tasks about faults and respond to faults without hanging or failing.

    \subsubsection {Resource Control:}
    PVM is inherently dynamic in nature. Computing resources can be added or deleted any time. In a long­running application in which the user occasionally wishes to attach a graphical front­end to view the computation's progress. Without virtual machine dynamics, the graphical workstation would have to be allocated during the entire computation. MPI lacks such dynamics and is, in fact, specifically designed to be static in nature to improve performance.
    Abeetles intends to be such an application - fast running, with rare user requests for graphical view of progress (possibly) or graphs and metrics of the course of the computation. Thus PVM should serve better for the case of Abeetles.

    \subsubsection {Process Control:}
    Ability to stop and start tasks in included both in MPI(v.2.0) and PVM.

    \subsubsection {Portability versus Interoperability:}
    MPI programs are only portable, which means that they can be ported from one architecture to another, compiled and executed without modification. PVM programs can be dealt in the same way, but moreover can also communicate with each other.

    \subsubsection{Context for Safe Communication:}
    Offered by both MPI and PVM (v.3.4.)

    \subsubsection{Speed:}
    MPI is expected to be faster within a large multiprocessor. Reason is MPI's simplicity.

\section {Genetical Algorithm}

\subsection {Choice of genetical algorithm for Abeetles}

Representation of an agent(beetle) in Abeetles from genetical point of view:
Chromosome of a beetle is the set of variables, representing the beetle:

Brain [2][4][4][4] = 128B

I will consider the individual brain decisions as noninteracting and availe placing of a crossover point anywhere after finished set of decisions

I want following variables to be logicaly noninteracting and thus it should be possible to place a crossover point anywhere among them. Hence I represent the expectations on a partner as relative divergence from other values.

ExpectOnPartner - Age [2] = 2B how much older / younger can be the partner
ExpectOnPartner - Energy = 1B how much more than ExpectOnPartner - InvInChild
ExpectOnPartner - InvInChild = 1B how much more than InvInChild
ExpectOnPartner - LearningAbility [2]= how much less/more can have the parter
InvInChild = 1B
HungryThreshold = 1B
LearningAbility = 1B

For implementation of crossover step the possible crossover points must be carefully chosen. The target is to find points, that availe separation of the genome into two noninteracting groups. Otherwise the crossover is not important for evolution and may be omitted.

Points can be placed between any pair of adjacent variables. Two created parts will be independent


Generally:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1.selection
  \item 2.crossover
    \begin{itemize}
      \item One-point crossover: This algorithm seems to be useful for the case of Abeetles. I will implement it as the first.
      \item Two-point crossover: This algorithm seems to be useful for the case of Abeetles. I will implement it.
      \item "Cut and splice": This technique is not suitable for case of Abeetles, because created children have different length of chromosomes.
      \item Uniform Crossover and Half Uniform Crossover: These aproaches may also be useful.
      \item Crossover for Ordered Chromosomes
    \end {itemize}
  \item 3.mutation
\end {itemize}

\section {Memory of beetles}
Beetles without memory have no chance to vary their decision, if the situation around them is constant. And if the decision is anything else than a step, their repeat this until they get hungry, die or the situation changes. But in case their are already hungry and the situation is a for long time constant, they are determined to die. And in the range of whole environment, if there are few beetles in the environment, they become extinct.
The other problematic situation ocurrs, when two beetles meet and want to copulate with each other. They might make a child or more, but then they do not have enough energy to create another child and get into deadlock, until situation around them changes or one of them dies. (Ne.. tohle nevadi, protoze se zmeni situace z hladove na nehladovou. Postreh: obecne nema smysl, aby hladovi broucci mohli volit akci A_COPULATE Postreh2: A je nutne, aby broucek pri kazdem setkani s jinym brouckem provedl A_COPULATE) Solution: omit action A_COPULATE from list of possible actions and include it as "hardwired". So this action will be performed always when in front of a beetle is another beetle and no decision will be made in this case. In case the copulation did not create a child beetle, e.a. expectations were not met, the decision for the case "beetle in the front" will be made according to the Brain table.

Ways how to solve this problem:
1. Flowers could besides growing also die back. Such a solution would  cause the environment to vary in every step, even if beetle don't eat the flowers.
2. Beetles could get aditional memory, to determine a deadlock-like situation. This could be done in several different ways:
a) remember n past coords - a beetle which does not move is likely to die.
b) remember n past actions - a beetle which does some other action than the step more than 3 times (rotation) or more than once (unsuccessful copulation) does it wastefully.
